                        platform
                        that speeds up the common steps performed in almost every assessment: vulnerability scanning,
                        attacking. Using the 20+ built-in tools, you get quick insights into targets' weaknesses so you
                        know
                        where to dig deeper, pop shells, and have fun.</p>
